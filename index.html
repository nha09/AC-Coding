    announced, and the flock from the Red Sand Lighthouse
    received the news with shrieks of relief. </p>

        and although the pilot gulls had found currents of
        warm air that made for pleasant gliding above the
        waves, they needed to renew their strength â€“ and what
        better for that than a good mess of herring? </pre>
